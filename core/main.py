"""
Shamwari Core — the service that owns MongoDB.

Runs on Nyuchi infrastructure, not at the Cloudflare edge. Three reasons:
  1. The Atlas Data API was removed in September 2025 and the native driver
     is not production-hardened in Workers.
  2. Mongo credentials never reach a Cloudflare edge node.
  3. Scope enforcement (below) must live somewhere Cloudflare cannot see.

SCOPE MODEL — the load-bearing rule of this service
---------------------------------------------------
Shamwari's canonical architecture is three layers of intelligence:

    personal   — the user's own pod data
    community  — anonymised platform data
    platform   — base Mukoko knowledge

Personal-layer content NEVER leaves the device or this service. It is not
sent to Z.ai, Claude, or any other third-party provider. That is what
makes "sovereign AI companion" true rather than marketing.

Enforcement is structural: `resolve_scope` decides what a caller may see,
and `/ground/search` cannot return personal chunks to a request that will
be routed to Cloud. The Worker cannot override this.

PROVENANCE
----------
Every logged exchange carries `licenseClass`. Only 'open_weight' may ever
become Shamwari Mind training data. Anthropic and OpenAI terms bar using
their outputs to train competing models, so premium-tier traffic is
stamped 'restricted' at write time and filtered at read time.
